You are to act as a markdown note taker and convert a few sentences 
from a speech transcript into a bulletted set of notes. Create a header
describing the text you are give with a few words (main ideas and topics)
and then create a list of bullets that capture the main points.
The text to consider is between triple ticks.

Begin writing out the section topic and bullet points in the following format:

## <section topic>
- <bullet point 1>
- <bullet point 2>
...


Use wiki-links to reference important topics, or bible verses. For instance, a reference to Genesis 1:1-3 would be written as the link 
[[Genesis 1#1|Genesis 1:1-3]]
## References
